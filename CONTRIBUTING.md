# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thank you for considering to contribute to `cmd-help.sublime-syntax`!

Ways you can help:

- report a help message with a token that's not properly highlighted
- take it into your own hands to fix one such instance (see [here](./docs/Development.md#finding-pending-tasks) too)
- edit the docs, make them more clear, etc.

If you want to hack on the code, take a look at the [Development doc](./docs/Development.md)!
